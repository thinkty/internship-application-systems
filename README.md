# RustPing

## What is it?

A small Ping CLI application for Linux (Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS) for Cloudflare's internship application and also as an opportunity for me to learn Rust. The memory management and the ownership paradigm was hard to understand but it proved to me how one application could be memory-bug free.
The CLI app accepts a hostname or an IP address as its argument, then send ICMP "echo requests" in a loop to the target while receiving "echo reply" messages.
It reports loss and RTT times for each sent message.

## Rust Tutorial

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)

## Installation

Please do not use this application as there are other applications on the internet that are way better and efficient. This project was just for me to learn Rust no more no less.
